#Bont

This is a staic mock up page of [**bonton.com**](http://www.bonton.com). The assignment was to create a static business website with 5 pages. For this assignment I used **HTML and CSS/Bootstrap**

#bonton
This is the final itteration to the [**Bont**](https://github.com/mfcastro/javascriptPractice/tree/master/Bont) project above. In this project I used **HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, Javascript (JQuery, Node.js Express.js)** to make a dynamic website.  

In this project I created an express server from scration instead of using the express generator command. 

#bontonsite
This project was intended to practice using the express applicaiton generator. This project is just an extension of the [**Bont**](https://github.com/mfcastro/javascriptPractice/tree/master/Bont) project. The [**bonton**](https://github.com/mfcastro/javascriptPractice/tree/master/bonton) project was created using concepts leaned from the express applicaiton generator.
